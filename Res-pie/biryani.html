                Fried onions: 1/2 cup (from the sliced onions)
                Mint leaves: A handful, chopped
                Coriander leaves: A handful, chopped
                Ghee: 2 tablespoons

                Mixed vegetables: 2 cups (carrots, beans, peas, and potatoes, diced and boiled)
                Preparation
                
                Making biryani involves several stages: preparing the rice, marinating the chicken or preparing vegetables, cooking the masala, and layering everything together.
                
                Step 1: Preparing the Rice
                
                Wash the basmati rice thoroughly under running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.
                Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain it.
                In a large pot, bring 8 cups of water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt.
                Add the soaked rice to the boiling water and cook until it is 70-80% done. The grains should be firm but not fully cooked.
                Drain the rice using a colander and spread it on a large plate or tray to cool.
                Step 2: Marinating the Chicken or Preparing Vegetables
                
                If using chicken or mutton, mix the meat with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour or 
                overnight for best results.
                For vegetable biryani, boil the diced vegetables until they are just tender. Do not overcook them, as they will cook further during layering.
                Step 3: Cooking the Biryani Masala
                
                Heat oil or ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pan. Add the sliced onions and fry them until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnishing.
                Add the green chilies and ginger-garlic paste to the pan and sauté until the raw smell disappears.
                Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and the oil begins to separate.
                Mix in the turmeric powder, red chili powder, biryani masala powder, and salt. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
                If using chicken or mutton, add the marinated meat to the pan and cook until it is tender and the masala is well-coated. If using vegetables, add the boiled vegetables and mix well.
                Add chopped mint and coriander leaves for a burst of freshness.
                Step 4: Layering the Biryani
                
                In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a deep baking dish, begin layering the biryani. Start with a layer of the cooked masala (chicken, mutton, or vegetables) at the bottom.
                Add a layer of cooked rice on top of the masala.
                Sprinkle a portion of the saffron milk, fried onions, mint leaves, and coriander leaves over the rice.
                Repeat the layers until all the masala and rice are used up, finishing with a layer of rice on top.
                Drizzle the remaining saffron milk and ghee over the final layer.
                Step 5: Dum Cooking (Sealing and Cooking the Biryani)
                
                Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid or cover it with aluminum foil to trap the steam.
                Place the pot on a low flame and cook for 20-25 minutes. Alternatively, you can bake the biryani in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 25-30 minutes.
                To prevent the biryani from burning, you can place a griddle (tawa) under the pot while cooking on the stovetop.
                Step 6: Serving
                
                Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers slightly without breaking the rice grains.
                Serve hot with raita, papad, or a side of salan (gravy). Garnish with more fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves for a touch of elegance.
                Tips for Perfect Biryani
                
                Use high-quality basmati rice for long, fragrant grains.
                Ensure the rice is only partially cooked during boiling to avoid overcooking during dum.
                Marinate the meat for an extended period to enhance its flavor and tenderness.
                Use a heavy-bottomed pot to prevent burning during dum cooking.
                Adjust the spice levels and seasoning to suit your taste preferences.
                Variations
                
                Hyderabadi Biryani: Known for its dum cooking method, this version includes a rich blend of spices and saffron.
